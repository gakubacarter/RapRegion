summer's mine\nYeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga went\nTo hang for a hundred grinds, a hundred grinds\nYeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga been\nDown for a hundred nights\nYeah, down for a hundred grinds\nI been on a mission, I been on a mission\nI need you and shawty kissin'\nI been on a mission\nIt ain't too much I can\nIt ain't too much that I listen, but I listen\nStill gettin' paid off this vision\nStill gettin' money off the mission\nStill came down off a mission\n\n[Chorus: Tory Lanez]\nYou are the 4am flex for me\nYou are the 4am flex for me\nYou are the 4am flex for me\nYou are the 4am flex for a nigga\nLight the weed and like to go, baby\nWhen I light this blunt inside your show, baby\nI'm gettin' high as fuck, I'm high enough, baby\nAnd baby, I wanna get to know you\n\n[Verse: Fabolous]\nYeah...\nI be out late tryna get it but you wait up for me\nMiss dinner 'cause I'm eatin', tell 'em put a plate up for me\nThey be comin' sideways, you gon' get that straight up from me\nIt's always get your weight up not your hate up from me\nIt came to me from finessin', baby\nBy they time it get to you, it's just a blessin', baby\nThey tried to overlook me, underestimate me\nShinin' like a diamond, I guess I been under pressure lately\nMake-up off and she still pretty\nI'm on my way and I'm still litty\nI like her 'cause she needs no practice\nDon't wear panties, I like easy access\nKnow her role like she's an actress\nLaid up with your boy, G's in the mattress\n4am flexin' on them lonely hoes\nSippin' Bobby Brown, Tenderoni flows\nMy heart belongs to a Roni\nShe's my only lover, she's my only love\nYeah, my heart belongs to a Roni\nShe's my only lover, she's my only love, ha...\n\n[Refrain: Tory Lanez]\nShawty made me feel like the summertime\nFeelin' like the summer's mine\nYeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga went\nTo hang for a hundred grinds, a hundred grinds\nYeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga been\nDown for a hundred nights\nYeah, down for a hundred grinds\nI been on a mission, I been on a mission\nI need you and shawty kissin'\nI been on a mission\nIt ain't too much I can\nIt ain't too much that I listen, but I listen\nStill gettin' paid off this vision\nStill gettin' money off the mission\nStill came down off a mission\n\n[Chorus: Tory Lanez]\nYou are the 4am flex for me\nYou are the 4am flex

yo, sit back relax, sip ya Cognac, young insomniac\nCause you sleep the 'hood will wash you like a laundromat\nSneak attack and trap from cats who pop collar\nIn fact your dog will be on a shirt like a Rottweiler\n\n[Verse 1: Fabolous]\nSome say I'm funny style, I say I'm \"getting money style\"\nNiggas get shot every day, shit ain't even funny now\nThe streets is hungry, I remember how my tummy growled\nI was just a bummy child, now they see me come in Childs\nMade a mill, my life is looking yummy now\nLearned from being broke don't get rich and be a dummy now\nCause rap niggas turning mummy now\nHosting all black parties, eyes teary, nose runny now\nSo warn your brothers, yeah them carats cost a hundred thou\nBut when it's over, that's all folks, Bugs Bunny style\nAin't see it before, my eyes is 20/20 now\nUsed to keep it a hunnid, them niggas funny money now\nSo I got the two-seater, keep your honey from me now\nPaint white, seats tan, shit look honey bunny now\nYeah, shout out to homies on the Ave still\nThere's no Love in the game, that's how the Cavs feel\n\n[Verse 2: Paul Cain]\nYo my mind's hard-wired for crime, career crook\nFrom the cradle that's just how I'm designed\nCertified street king, I'm the last of my kind\nFor how he lived, not for the way that he died, is how a man is defined\nThese new niggas, quick to shoot without looking, blind fury\nAll pussy, when the wolfpack loose they hide jury\nThey hide when I fly by, high in that 5 Series\nDon't care how cool you think they is, don't bring them guys near me\nNever trust a soul, fuck what the 'hood think\nFirst they took Stack from us, then they took Chinx\nSurvival of the fit, the hunger is real\nMy city is like a concrete jungle for real\nKill or be killed in my mindset since I was twelve\nGetting money, eating good with my people and live well\nIf I don't find heaven on Earth, I raise hell\nYou see hellfire, escape from the barrel, I blaze shells\nTo this day I ask my man, \"How the fuck we escape cells\"?\nThe few who understand me, they come from the same hell\nThis shit I say is shocking, you stepped on a third rail\nYou gotta feel me to know what I'm saying -- Cain braille\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nSee I normally leave the classics alone\nNormally no B&E's without a map of the home\nFormally, I don't compare, all these rappers is clones\nYou ever sat on the throne, spattering poems, I massacre homes\nBut these new niggas beef different, they just send a sub at em\nMe, I'm still tinting the hoop, cocking the snub at em\nNiggas don't fuck wit 'em, I don't give a fuck again\nLeBron-inspired, musta thought I needed Love to win\nSmoke and mirrors, gotta be an illusion\nYou never see me disputing, I delete the confusion\nI scoop my nigga in that two-seater, we moving\nSoon as he extend an arm, we gon' reach a conclusion\nYou niggas never felt that pain, it's like torture\nWhen the shooter never come in for Teague (fatigue), like Korver\nNigga whole existence is to take them pies off ya\nWhen you see him you might often know that niggas might off ya", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b4c54bc230379b9bc79ffb5dba1569a6.960x960x1.jpg",

you like a laundromat\nSneak attack and trap from cats who pop collar\nIn fact your dog will be on a shirt like a Rottweiler\n\n[Verse 1: Fabolous]\nSome say I'm funny style, I say I'm \"getting money style\"\nNiggas get shot every day, shit ain't even funny now\nThe streets is hungry, I remember how my tummy growled\nI was just a bummy child, now they see me come in Childs\nMade a mill, my life is looking yummy now\nLearned from being broke don't get rich and be a dummy now\nCause rap niggas turning mummy now\nHosting all black parties, eyes teary, nose runny now\nSo warn your brothers, yeah them carats cost a hundred thou\nBut when it's over, that's all folks, Bugs Bunny style\nAin't see it before, my eyes is 20/20 now\nUsed to keep it a hunnid, them niggas funny money now\nSo I got the two-seater, keep your honey from me now\nPaint white, seats tan, shit look honey bunny now\nYeah, shout out to homies on the Ave still\nThere's no Love in the game, that's how the Cavs feel\n\n[Verse 2: Paul Cain]\nYo my mind's hard-wired for crime, career crook\nFrom the cradle that's just how I'm designed\nCertified street king, I'm the last of my kind\nFor how he lived, not for the way that he died, is how a man is defined\nThese new niggas, quick to shoot without looking, blind fury\nAll pussy, when the wolfpack loose they hide jury\nThey hide when I fly by, high in that 5 Series\nDon't care how cool you think they is, don't bring them guys near me\nNever trust a soul, fuck what the 'hood think\nFirst they took Stack from us, then they took Chinx\nSurvival of the fit, the hunger is real\nMy city is like a concrete jungle for real\nKill or be killed in my mindset since I was twelve\nGetting money, eating good with my people and live well\nIf I don't find heaven on Earth, I raise hell\nYou see hellfire, escape from the barrel, I blaze shells\nTo this day I ask my man, \"How the fuck we escape cells\"?\nThe few who understand me, they come from the same hell\nThis shit I say is shocking, you stepped on a third rail\nYou gotta feel me to know what I'm saying -- Cain braille\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Budden]\nSee I normally leave the classics alone\nNormally no B&E's without a map of the home\nFormally, I don't compare, all these rappers is clones\nYou ever sat on the throne, spattering poems, I massacre homes\nBut these new niggas beef different, they just send a sub at em\nMe, I'm still tinting the hoop, cocking the snub at em\nNiggas don't fuck wit 'em, I don't give a fuck again\nLeBron-inspired, musta thought I needed Love to win\nSmoke and mirrors, gotta be an illusion\nYou never see me disputing, I delete the confusion\nI scoop my nigga in that two-seater, we moving\nSoon as he extend an arm, we gon' reach a conclusion\nYou niggas never felt that pain, it's like torture\nWhen the shooter never come in for Teague (fatigue), like Korver\nNigga whole existence is to take them pies off ya\nWhen you see him you might often know that niggas might off ya"}}, {"title": "Ah Man", "album": "Summertime Shootout 2: The Level Up", "year": "2016-09-03", "lyrics": "[Verse: Fabolous]\nYo, dog been gettin' money, DMX like\nBeen in these streets since BMX

fuck shit\nI'm ridin' wit whoever that I hop out the truck wit'\nSlidin' with the sticks on some slap-in-the-puck shit\nNo hockey, just riders, no jockey\nChinese food, less beef, more broccoli\nMy fortune cookie said stay humble, flow cocky\nCall the jeweler A$AP, time to go Rocky\nMy chain glisten, bright enough to change vision\nShortie see I'm everything that these lames isn't\nTold you I could take your bitch, you ain't listen\nI heard the friend zone feel like you in Bane prison\nFly little joint, her weave just hang different\nBought her that Malaysia, she went plane missin'\nI put her in that fast lane no more lane switchin'\nTold her keep curvin' them niggas don't change pitches\nBenchriders, comin' in the game dissin'\nFame fishin', tryna-get-a-name mission\nMy team gon rush you niggas, we came blitzin'\nMy boy got that AK wit' him he came swizzin'\nI bang vixens, main chicks and game kicks in\nHit it and fall back on em, game sixin'\nKeep them broke bitches away, we ain't fixin'\nYou chasin' baby? I'm straight, ain't mixin'!\nDusse straight up, cause dues say paid up\nIt's go time Rugs, fuck who say wait up\nYou in ATL, then my crew may skate up\nLike T.I. flick, handle B.I. quick\nAll my niggas bring em home, R.B.I. chicks\nAll you niggas talk to the FBI Quick, rats\nSprinter full of Splinters\nI was gettin paper like a printer through the winter\nWeather break I might get the Bent or the Aventa-\nDor, more, adventures of a center\nBig nigga ballin', big figures callin'\nShe hooked on me, she a big-dick-a-holic\nTryna stay above water that's just some duck shit\nTryna stash a hundred mil, keep it a buck shit\nWe stay winnin' baby this ain't no luck shit\nRest of these niggas ain't nothin' to fuck wit\n\n[Outro: DJ Clue]\nDJ Clue, Desert Storm\nFabolous, that Street Fam\nOh

modern-day crisis, these freestyles are priceless\nAll you gon' hear is God damns and Jesus Christes\nWhile these 90s beats become religious sacrifices\nRap game's ISIS, studio terrorism\nLira Galore came through, helped me with the lyricism\nThese is hard bars, type you only hear in prison\nSwag rap got you blind, this shit'll clear your vision\nGrass cut low, so you can catch em' being snake\nCause everybody real 'til you catch 'em bein' fake\nAnd I write my mean shit when I'm in a nice mood\nAnd Friday's ain't been this good since Ice Cube's\nSee, behind every nice dude is a monster\nThey say behind every bad bitch is a sponsor\nJust remember that this time could be your last time\nThat's why I'm out here rappin' like it's my last rhyme\nSo, stop complaining and get in your swag\nIn other words, get out your feelings and get in your bag\nMy nigga, your biggest problem is you care too much\nAnd you always around, you be there too much\nAnd it's, Fuck what you heard cause you hear too much\nYou just a lookin'-ass nigga and you stare too much\nAnd over here we don't care for such\nIt's so real, shorty still hop in and be like, Here's your dutch\nAnd now we rollin', blowin' Cali in the whip, stylin'\nShe actin' like it's a molly and her shit smilin'\nShe ain't listen, she probably in the whip wildin'\nSuckin' like it's the Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge\nUh, play-off game on the seventy-inch\nAnd I'm the type of player that never get benched\nBitches wanna hang you, never the lynch\nI'm tryin' to live this dream and never get pinched\nJust somethin' 'bout my shit, I got it figured out\nBitch, I don't need your number, I'm seven-figured out\nNowadays, it looks like talk is all these niggas 'bout\nSeems like the smallest pockets always have the biggest mouth\nAnd being broke is a joke, I know I shouldn't laugh\nThat's why I come for everything they said I couldn't have\nBefore I go, only thing I want to mention is...\nMoney ain't the root of all evil now, attention is\n\n[Hook]\nChillin', sittin' in a Ghost, quarter-million\nWhile all these niggas actin' jealous in their feelings\nNext few years, I'm a stack it to the ceilin'\nAll for the

are priceless\nAll you gon' hear is God damns and Jesus Christes\nWhile these 90s beats become religious sacrifices\nRap game's ISIS, studio terrorism\nLira Galore came through, helped me with the lyricism\nThese is hard bars, type you only hear in prison\nSwag rap got you blind, this shit'll clear your vision\nGrass cut low, so you can catch em' being snake\nCause everybody real 'til you catch 'em bein' fake\nAnd I write my mean shit when I'm in a nice mood\nAnd Friday's ain't been this good since Ice Cube's\nSee, behind every nice dude is a monster\nThey say behind every bad bitch is a sponsor\nJust remember that this time could be your last time\nThat's why I'm out here rappin' like it's my last rhyme\nSo, stop complaining and get in your swag\nIn other words, get out your feelings and get in your bag\nMy nigga, your biggest problem is you care too much\nAnd you always around, you be there too much\nAnd it's, Fuck what you heard cause you hear too much\nYou just a lookin'-ass nigga and you stare too much\nAnd over here we don't care for such\nIt's so real, shorty still hop in and be like, Here's your dutch\nAnd now we rollin', blowin' Cali in the whip, stylin'\nShe actin' like it's a molly and her shit smilin'\nShe ain't listen, she probably in the whip wildin'\nSuckin' like it's the Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge\nUh, play-off game on the seventy-inch\nAnd I'm the type of player that never get benched\nBitches wanna hang you, never the lynch\nI'm tryin' to live this dream and never get pinched\nJust somethin' 'bout my shit, I got it figured out\nBitch, I don't need your number, I'm seven-figured out\nNowadays, it looks like talk is all these niggas 'bout\nSeems like the smallest pockets always have the biggest mouth\nAnd being broke is a joke, I know I shouldn't laugh\nThat's why I come for everything they said I couldn't have\nBefore I go, only thing I want to mention is...\nMoney ain't the root of all evil now, attention is\n\n[Hook]\nChillin', sittin' in a Ghost, quarter-million\nWhile all these niggas actin' jealous in their feelings\nNext few years, I'm a stack it to the ceilin'\nAll for the love and keep killin', yeah\n\nChillin', sittin' in a Ghost, quarter-million\nWhile all these niggas actin' jealous in their feelings\nNext few years, I'm a stack it to the ceilin'\nAll for the love and keep killin', yeah"}}, {"title": "All Good", "album": "The

the buildings\nThat I was hustling from, that called the police on me\nIt's all good, baby baby\n'Cause I went from the negative to the positive\nAnd it's all\"\n\n[Chorus]\nGood times like J.J. and them\nIt was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them\nIt was Goodfellas like Henry and them\nBut nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them\nSo if you a good girl, let me see your hands\nLet these niggas know, every chance that you can\nIf you got that good good\nShorty, please raise your hand\nYou know its all good, you just need a good man\nIf you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man\n'Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan\nGot somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man\nAnd if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm talking good dudes, good vibes and some good food\nSmokin' good with a playlist full of good grooves\nYou know the shit you like to hear, like good news\nA couple Megan Goods came through, made the hood move\nIn slow motion for me\nShe be frontin' like \"Why all this commotion for me?\"\nThey talk about her shit, like they doing promotion for it\nBut she single, 'cause they never show devotion for it\nShe ain't never act too good for a nigga\nBut she losing faith, she don't see no good in these niggas\nShe like why I get treated bad, but be good to a nigga\nYou do bad, you lose, too bad, good for you nigga, it was\n\n[Chorus]\nGood times like J.J. and them\nIt was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them\nIt was Goodfellas like Henry and them\nBut nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them\nSo if you a good girl, let me see your hands\nLet these niggas know, every chance that you can\nIf you got that good good\nShorty, please raise your hand\nYou know its all good, you just need a good man\nIf you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man\n'Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan\nGot somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man\nAnd if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand\n\n[Verse 2]\nShootin' Cee-lo with my Goodie Mob\nYellin' that I fall better, life is a gamble\nI was good luck for the betters\nTake a risk nigga, you gotta shoot to miss, nigga\nTime is golden, like that Rollie on your wrist, nigga\nI hate when they gets figures, then disfigured\nAnd when niggas get salty thinkin' that shit's sugar\nThat's when good goes bad\nThat's when niggas who just came home, could go back\nSo let's keep the vibe right, keep the energy good\nThem boys'll sit you down player like a injury would\nThem my niggas fuck with me, before the industry would\nRiding 'til the wheels fall off and the engine no good, it was\n\n[Chorus]\nGood times like J.J. and them\nIt was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them\nIt was Goodfellas like Henry and them\nBut nowadays good girls,

never amount to nothing\nFor all the people who lived above the buildings\nThat I was hustling from, that called the police on me\nIt's all good, baby baby\n'Cause I went from the negative to the positive\nAnd it's all\"\n\n[Chorus]\nGood times like J.J. and them\nIt was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them\nIt was Goodfellas like Henry and them\nBut nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them\nSo if you a good girl, let me see your hands\nLet these niggas know, every chance that you can\nIf you got that good good\nShorty, please raise your hand\nYou know its all good, you just need a good man\nIf you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man\n'Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan\nGot somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man\nAnd if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm talking good dudes, good vibes and some good food\nSmokin' good with a playlist full of good grooves\nYou know the shit you like to hear, like good news\nA couple Megan Goods came through, made the hood move\nIn slow motion for me\nShe be frontin' like \"Why all this commotion for me?\"\nThey talk about her shit, like they doing promotion for it\nBut she single, 'cause they never show devotion for it\nShe ain't never act too good for a nigga\nBut she losing faith, she don't see no good in these niggas\nShe like why I get treated bad, but be good to a nigga\nYou do bad, you lose, too bad, good for you nigga, it was\n\n[Chorus]\nGood times like J.J. and them\nIt was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them\nIt was Goodfellas like Henry and them\nBut nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them\nSo if you a good girl, let me see your hands\nLet these niggas know, every chance that you can\nIf you got that good good\nShorty, please raise your hand\nYou know its all good, you just need a good man\nIf you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man\n'Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan\nGot somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man\nAnd if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand\n\n[Verse 2]\nShootin' Cee-lo with my Goodie Mob\nYellin' that I fall better, life is a gamble\nI was good luck for the betters\nTake a risk nigga, you gotta shoot to miss, nigga\nTime is golden, like that Rollie on your wrist, nigga\nI hate when they gets figures, then disfigured\nAnd when niggas get salty thinkin' that shit's sugar\nThat's when good goes bad\nThat's when niggas who just came home, could go back\nSo let's keep the vibe right, keep the energy good\nThem boys'll sit you down player like a injury would\nThem my niggas fuck with me, before the industry would\nRiding 'til the wheels fall off and the engine no good, it was\n\n[Chorus]\nGood times like J.J. and them\nIt was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them\nIt was Goodfellas like Henry and them\nBut nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them\nSo if you a good girl, let me see your hands\nLet these niggas know, every chance that you

in love\nGirl, I just want you, you, you, that's all I want\nYou, you, listen, I can't lie, I think I'm fallin' in love\nGirl, I just want you, you, you, that's all I want\nYou, you, all I

me explain?\nIt's one o'clock in the mornin', still up and I'm yawnin'\nObvious that I'm tired, but I'm late up just dawnin'\nOn all the things that we been through, all the places we been to\nI can't see myself wit' no one else other than you\nMy appetite continues, you're the main cause of my menu\nFeel like I'm at that stage and you headlinin' my venue\nYou think I play by what I say, but I don't\nIf I know nothin' else, I know what I want, Trey, tell 'em what I want\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Fabolous]\nMy advice: make your next move your best move\nYeah, and use your ex-boo as your excuse\nI'm moving like a king, yes, I'm just a chess dude\nAnd protecting your queen, now, that's a good chess move\nCause king and queen, that's royalty, all I want is your loyalty\nIf it's wrong, you'll make it right, all I want is that warranty\nAin't even your birthday, but you could get a couple gifts from me\nThat black box say 'Chanel' on it, that blue box say 'Tiffany'\nTan box say 'Louboutin', brown box say 'Louis Vuitton'\nAnd you got them Js though, size six in them new LeBrons\nYou think I play by what I say, but I don't\nIf I know nothin' else, I know what I want, tell me what you want\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Fabolous]\nUh, I want is you now, all I want is you now\nIf you know what you want, let me hear you say, 'Oh'\nAnd if you know what I want, let me hear you say, 'Oh'\nYou got to use what you got just to get what you want\nThem hips give it away, I can see that shit from the front\nWant to hold that, feel that, touch that really slow\nUp, down, left, right, in, out, really though\nHad some bad ones, even had fun all at once\nThat's temporary, check cemetery, that's dead, you all I want", "image":

Williams\nMoney Mike, I gets money on the mic\nAnd some say I'm wild'n out\nBargadi styling out, pushing seven digits dialing\nBut i ain't gotta f**king choice\nMy money talks in a Chris Tucker voice\n\"And you know this man\"\nYou a stand up rapper, hip hop comedian\nI start laughing as soon as i put your CD in\nYou joke, you joke, you kid, you kid\nShould have went to Comedy Central with the vids you did\nBut ok, you B.E.T. only if its Comic View\nPromise you I'm funny style I can be a comic too\nI'm Marty Mar, at a Auty Mar\nCute snotty broad, tits like Dolly Par\nEd Harty naw this is carty ma\nBut that was a good one, Hardy har\nLambo Galardi car getting my last laugh HAW\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Pusha T's Verse]\nThe jokes on you niggas\nSee the figures don't add up to the claims\nYou Sam Kinnison you just screaming names\nMy brother my partner for real like the Wayans\nPlus everything in live In Living Color\nHigh rise checks diamonds the size of Robin Harris'\nI Bebe Kids my neck\nYou call it a tribute, a ?? distribute\nSales was slow i got Paco to contribute\nSome morals in each state, move weight, get caught\nDon't talk, Dave Chappelle niggas might break\nSo hilarious, how the chariots, carry us\nPhantom is light gray sort of like Ashy Larry is\nKing of the one liner lil' rhymers watch what you say\nYou just a potty mouth like Andrew Dice Clay\nI pop collars on niggas, i drop dollars on niggas\nI jell O's together i Bill Cosby on niggas\nGot you lost in the smoke i Micheal Connelly you niggas\nI watch u verse from the fire i Richard Pryor you niggas\nSaid enough nigga sort of like Kramer\nI'm joking you don't wanna see the anger Fab tell'em\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Fabolous' Verse 2]\nMane look, the diamonds in your chain look\nFunnier than Dane Cook, you hit the Sufi\nI am to fly, in the booth I\nMake joke of them, i ain't the richest nigga but i ain't broke as them\nI'm serious, petty worth will make a man delirious like Eddie Murph\nGirls get curious\nIs he really funny, don't be silly honey\nI'm the burner packing\nBernie Macing\nI ain't scared of you maf**kers kick ass\nHon stack thick ass\nA deck of card VIP section hard\nThey try to holla at me you know the heckler broads\nI'm popping Rose, I don't the neck to God\nDon't front yo, i be in the front row\nWatch your wise cracks or i'll be at your front door\nAnd i push up on a female smoothly, in a GL but keep that on the D.L. Hughley\nLOL this is LOS\nO no your money coming so slow guess this maf**kers a no show, Oh oh oh\n\n[Chorus]"}}, {"title": "All The Way Turnt Up", "album": "There Is No Competition 2 (The Funeral Service)", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Hook]\nAnd shawty we all the way turnt up\nAll the way turnt up\nAll the way turnt up\nAll the way turnt up\nAll the way turnt up\nAll the way turnt up\nAll the way turnt up\nAll the way turnt up\n\n[Verse 1: Fabolous]\nWe ballin' over here\nTune into the game\nCall me Rose Bryant\nCall Patron James\nWe walk up in this jawn thick\nTell em play my song quick\nAnd we gone make a fuckin' movie\nLike a porn flick\n\nWe on a mission\nWe the James Bond clique\nWe gon' kill em till the bars close, Convict\nShawty I was born slick\nShort temper long dick\nHit you with this magic stick\nAfter that we gone trick\n\nWala no leash on my colla'\nAnd if that bitch is molla'\nI'm single as a dolla'\nSmoke west coast kush\nIn my boy Impala\nGot me in the Carmelo\nFuckin' with that Lala\n\nNiggas say they can't be seen\nAin't nobody lookin' though\nTurn the heat up on that beef\nAin't nobody cookin' though\nA section full of them bitches\nThat Yo Gotti Lookin' foe\n\nYeah that's them 5 stars\nThey get money drive cars\nThey got them bangin' bodies\nWith out the knife scar\nThey take them shots to the head\nAnd survive y'all...

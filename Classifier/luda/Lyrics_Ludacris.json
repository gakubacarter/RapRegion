ACT A FOOL\nNow your friends just smoked up your brand new stash\nSay whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nNow them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nIf anyone talk bad about the Dirty South\nTell me what I'm gon do? ACT A FOOL\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open\nDid donuts last week and the streets still smoking\nSee, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is TIPSY\nOff the off ramp doin about a hundred and fifty\nRollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill\nSlide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield\nGot the whole crew ridin and we startin SHIT\nI even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit\nNow all you wanna do is get drunk and pout\nPlus your new name is Fire cuz we stomped you out\nAnd yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic\nSo gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic\nI kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart\nYou'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart\nIt's one mission, two clips and some triple beams\nI'm ABOUT TO BLOW THIS WHOLE SHIT UP TO SMITHEREENS\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nThe pot holes in the street just bentcha rims\nTell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nMAN, THAT AIN'T STICKY, THAT'S JUST STICKS AND STEMS\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nCatch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed\nLadies whatcha gon do?

Fast\nDrop! 2 Furious\nI'm too fast for y'all, man\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nAHH, you just came home from doin a bid\nTell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nSomebody broke in and cleaned out your crib\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nJust bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes\nTell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nNow them cops tryna throw you in them county blues\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nTalkin about gats, traps, cops and robbers\nIt's 9-1-1, PLEASE CALL THE DOCTOR\nEvacuate the building and trick the pigs\nSince everybody wanna piece, we gon split ya wigs\nSee some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries\nYou about to catch a cold, STAY THE FUCK AROUND FROM ME\nYa peeps talkin 'bout what kinda shits he on\nYou disappear like \"POOF, BITCH BE GONE\"\nYou think twelve gon' catch me, GIMMIE A BREAK\nI'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate\nIt seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years\nThey'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears\nI got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash\nSheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain on the stash\nHydraulics all around so I shake the ride\nWe go FRONT, BACK AND SIDE TO SIDE, WHAT\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nSome punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink\nTell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nNow your car just stopped on a empty tank\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nIf you got late bills and you lost your job\nTell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nIf you about to get drunk and you ready to mob\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nLet's take it to the streets cuz I'm ready to cruise\nJust bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes\nAnd the people just stare so I LOVE TO PARK IT\nAnd I just put a computer in the glove compartment\nWith the pedal to the floor, radar in the GRILLE\nTV in the middle of my STEERING WHEEL\nIt's my car's birthday so we BLOWIN THEM CANDLES\nMore speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle\nGot my name in the headrest, read it and weep\nNOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat\nAnd when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection\nCuz the women love the paint and they can see their reflection\nI'm about to take off, so F what ya heard\nBecause my side mirrors flap like a FUCKIN BIRD\nAnd the fools, we gon CLOCK ONE and we'll POP ONE\nCuz my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nYou just got hustled for a wad of cash\nMan whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nNow your friends just smoked up your brand new stash\nSay whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nNow them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nIf anyone talk bad about the Dirty South\nTell me what I'm gon do? ACT A FOOL\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open\nDid donuts last week and the streets still smoking\nSee, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is TIPSY\nOff the off ramp doin about a hundred and fifty\nRollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill\nSlide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield\nGot the whole crew ridin and we startin SHIT\nI even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit\nNow all you wanna do is get drunk and pout\nPlus your new name is Fire cuz we stomped you out\nAnd yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic\nSo gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic\nI kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart\nYou'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart\nIt's one mission, two clips and some triple beams\nI'm ABOUT TO BLOW THIS WHOLE SHIT UP TO SMITHEREENS\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nThe pot holes in the street just bentcha rims\nTell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nMAN, THAT AIN'T STICKY, THAT'S JUST STICKS AND STEMS\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nCatch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed\nLadies whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nIf the bottles all gone and your eyes are red\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\n\n[Ludacris]\n2 Fast, 2 Furious...\n2 Fast... ACT A FOOL\n2 Fast, 2 Furious...\n2 Fast...

puff passing \u2018em\nUntil they roaches, buried in my ashtray\nNigga burn slow, better pray like it\u2019s your last day\nYou lying to yourself, just admit it\nMay not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy\nDo your research before you make a claim so bogus\nThat's disrespecting pioneers in the game\nFuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes\nThen you front line cadets

rappers say I\u2019m stealing their flows\nBut I can\u2019t steal what you never made up bitch\nY\u2019all some duplicate rap cloning niggas\nI manufacture you hoes -- put on your makeup, bitch\nLet me explain, nothing\u2019s been new since Big Daddy Kane\nFlows will get recycled passed around to different names\nBut what\u2019s the same, that every verse I spit is insane\nGot more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting\nAnd y'all get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting\nWho\u2019s gassing \u2018em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but I\u2019m just puff puff passing \u2018em\nUntil they roaches, buried in my ashtray\nNigga burn slow, better pray like it\u2019s your last day\nYou lying to yourself, just admit it\nMay not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy\nDo your research before you make a claim so bogus\nThat's disrespecting pioneers in the game\nFuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes\nThen you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants\nSee I\u2019m ya past, I\u2019m ya future and ya present\nSo watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend\n16 times platinum, 6 number 1 peaks\nSo I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week\nYou\u2019s weak, softer than the Pillsbury dough boy\nDon\u2019t make me expose the truth, you\u2019s a ho, boy\nDon\u2019t make me get on that \"Stomp\" shit and get back at it\nYou rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket\nWhy am I wasting my time\nYeah I admit I get a little ludicrous with my rhymes, sometimes\nBut my fans know the difference because \u201cMy Chick Bad\u201d went platinum\nStill winning, motherfucker\n\nThe nerve of you niggas man\nYou ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy\nFall back in formation, y\u2019all outta line\nI was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon\nSo the next time you gnats got a real problem\nDon\u2019t be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to me going on twitter rants and shit\nNigga, say it to my face"}}, {"title": "Beast Mode", "album": "Ludaversal", "year": "2015-03-31", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nUh, mic check 1-2 (Go get

emcees for breakfast, bitch\nSince I was born to touch the mic,The First Time it's been a problem\nYour life was a mistake, your pops should've wore a condom\nYou niggas think you hard, I think you better come harder (Go hard)\nI leave rappers confused, like will.i.am's barber\nAh, fuckin' with Luda's not a great look\nA verse'll make your fans, unfriend you on Facebook\nClick, my styles are goin' into labor\nSo if stars won a war, I'm their daddy like Darth Vader\nAnd since I'm always high, it's kind of hard to overlook me\nFor over a hundred stacks, it's kind of hard to overbook me\nAnd a whole 'nother house for my cars is on my checklist\nCause to fit 'em in one garage, is like a nigga playin' Tetris\nBut they say patience is a virtue, cause I got your bitch stayin' out way past her curfew\nGuess I was a thief, that got away with these words\nSlangin' chickens out my whip, like I been playin' Angry Birds\nIn a black Rolls Royce, Dark Knight like Batman\nEverywhere you turn, the Ghost follows like Pac-Man\nAnd I sleep with the John Dillinger\nAnd always keep an eye half-open, like Forest Whitaker\nNo, you boys ain't ready for combat\nBe more worried if I renew my Def Jam contract\nWhat path is he on?

thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted\nYour whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it\nAnd y'all think I'm gon' stop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nIn one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast\nBut bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past\nPlus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass\nAnd y'all prayin that I flop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nIn New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green\nIn Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean\nAll these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin for sixteens\nTry 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nSee in just six months I infiltrated the system\nIf you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him\nNiggas hate givin me props cause I might use it against them\nC'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\n\n[Hook 2X: Ludacris]\nIf you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone\nIf you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home\nAnd if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong\nBut after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\n\n[Ludacris]\nIt's time to saddle up the Tontos cause I'm the Lone Ranger\nI eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers\nI'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer\nIf you ever think of stoppin me - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nI'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law\nAny charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall\nNext year I'm lookin into buyin Greenbriar Mall\nYou probably own a lot of property! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nC'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls\nPlus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls\nWe all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws\nI'm 'bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nShout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'mma throw you a curve\nYou mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words\nI'mma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves\nPepsi's the New Generation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nMy black people show me love when I'm up on the block\nAnd Latinos always waitin for my CD's to drop\nWhite people love the flow, they say, \"Dude, you fuckin rock!\"\nYo' fans are my fans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nSo find my album in the stores and look for the white steam\nRip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream\nIt's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream\nYo' scans are my scans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nNow Luda's throwin up A's, and I'm lightin up L's\nAround the globe gettin paid, you home bitin yo' nails\nDTP, the only label that practice fightin ourselves\nWe probably gettin on your nerves, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nI been eatin and gettin FAT while y'all dyin of hunger\nI get drunk in the winter, stay high in the summer\nWatch out, my album's puttin up McDonald's numbers\nYou over 6 million served, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\n\n[Hook]\n\nBLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nWHOO!"}}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
